Suppose there is an investment instrument that returns 4% annually. With an amount $A invested, at the end of every year, you can withdraw the profit 4% x $A and leave the principal invested to continue generating profit. You can do this forever.

Say that profit is enough for you to live on. So 4% x $A = annual expense. Thus $A = 25 x annual expense.

With 25 times your annual expense invested, you can live off your investment forever. This is the basic *belief* of the [FIRE movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement) (overly simplified by me). There are a lot of nuances to that, and I won't go into them here (read [Mr Money Mustache's](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) if you haven't).

For this post, I just want to share a simple formula that has helped me *quickly* visualize the impact of my daily financial choices.

Say you want to sign up for something that costs $50/month. That's $600/year. 25x of that is $15,000. That's the extra amount that you need to save and invest in order to afford paying $50/month while living off your investment profits.

In general, a $100/month expense requires $30,000 saved and invested. Reversely, if you reduce your monthly expenses by $100, it's $30,000 less you need to save and invest.

- **$1000 less** spent monthly, **\$300,000 less** needed for investment (and how long would you take to save that?)
- **$100 less** spent monthly, **\$30,000 less** needed for investment
- **$10 less** spent monthly, **\$3,000 less** needed for investment

Nuances withstanding, these quick conversions have helped me do faster cost-benefit analysis. Like how much of them daily take-out coffees do I really want?

***

From another angle, if you have $A invested right now, how much of your monthly expenses can you cover with $A / 300 (i.e. 25 x 12)?

- **$10,000** invested affords you **\$33** monthly
- **$100,000** invested affords you **\$333** monthly

What percentage of your *life* can you currently afford without working?
