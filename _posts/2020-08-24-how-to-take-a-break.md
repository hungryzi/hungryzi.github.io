You feel you need a change, but you don’t know what that looks like. You feel you’re not getting closer to where you want to be if you continue this trajectory or this speed. You’re tired most of the time, and feel like you're barely keeping your head above the water. You know you need to do something, but you don’t have a clear idea.

“But maybe this is good, I should be more grateful” - the “good student” within you objects. You may even hear your denial pleading: “The laziness in me is stirring again!” The laziness in you, in their turn, shouts: “The other options are full of pros and cons too, just like this one.” However, it's not recommendable to let fear, worries and laziness guide your life. At least, when that doesn't even make you happy.

It took me a few months to come to terms with taking a break. I had a lot of worries. But now a month into it, I feel great and am really glad that I did. Below are a few things I did to make that decision.

Firstly, you should make this decision in the right state of mind. It should be the state of mind where you **sincerely** want the best things to happen to yourself, where you know you, as any being, deserves compassion and opportunities. Where you accept that things happen, both good and bad, some are out of your control, but many are within, and you will focus on the latter.

I find a few minutes of [loving-kindness meditation](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/loving_kindness_meditation) really help to put me in that state. It helps put fear, guilt, complexes aside, and remind myself that I, as any being, deserves peace and being free from suffering (mental or physical).

Sit down. Take a few deep breaths. Focus on your breath. Repeat this a few times:

> May I be happy, May I live with ease. May I be free from anger, pain and suffering. May I be filled with peace, joy, and compassion for myself and for others.

After you’re calm and at ease, you can start thinking about the situation objectively. Some prompt questions to help you start:

If you’re not doing what you’re doing, you’re free to choose, what would you like doing in the next 3 months? 6 months? If you can choose anything, what would you like to do in 2 years? Do the things you want to do in 3 months help you get where you want to be in 2 years?

Now, do the things you’re doing now help you get where you want to be in 2 years? What are the pros and cons of it? Why are you tired? What is not working?

Sometimes I find writing your thinking down helps tremendously in distinguishing between concrete, tangible reasons and gut feelings. Both are important, but it’s important to know which is which.

I don’t make this kind of decision overnight. I like to sit with it for a while, think about it every day or two for a few weeks. You’ll find your feelings and mindset towards it change slightly, or a lot, day by day. It may be something you read, someone you talked to, food you eat, etc. that affect your feelings towards it. After a while though, my bet is that it does come back to a certain feeling. I hope that with a peaceful mind, that feeling also highlights a path for you to get out of your mental pit.

Maybe you realize that you do need to make big changes and are willing to deal with the unknowns and uncertainties. Maybe you find a few small adjustments to do that will relieve the stress and bring you closer to your path. Maybe the current situation is the best you can do right now, but you have a plan to save up and get out one day. Maybe you need a break to think things through, with an option to go back to what you’re doing. Maybe you need a break to prepare for your big jump.

Finally, I hope you know that people do take breaks. This is my second break from my not so long working life and I have both times come out better on the other side. It may not be popular, it may not be well-received, but it is an option for many of us.

> May you be happy. May you live with ease. May you be free from anger, pain, and suffering. May you be filled with peace, joy and loving kindness for yourself and others.
