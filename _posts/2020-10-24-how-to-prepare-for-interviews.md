title:  "HOW-TO prepare for interviews (software engineers)"
category: tech-careers
---

This is how I prepared in my recent job search. After a decade in start-ups, this time I aimed at bigger tech companies (for Senior Software Engineer role). I did research on their interview process and specifically prepared for them. I had interviews with Amazon, Square, Shopify, Twitter, Netflix in September 2020.

These steps are meant to be done **in parallel**. At the end of this post, I include a list of TODO items gathered from all the steps.

1. ### Brush up your ability to solve programming problems
	Most companies ask you to solve some programming problems. I found myself very rusty with them when I started. Revising data structures’ construct and their usages was really helpful for me. To do this quickly, I highly recommend [AlgoExpert’s membership](https://www.algoexpert.io/). Their videos are to the point and contain the most basic stuff you should know. Their list of 100 problems was certainly less intimidating than the boundless number of problems on LeetCode. 
	
	[LeetCode’s top interview questions](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/) were also helpful. I wasn’t asked any “hard” level problems, mostly just around the “medium” level.

1. ### Brush up on your ability to answer system design questions
	Again, I’d highly recommend AlgoExpert’s videos to understand the common system components and paradigms that you could use in this kind of questions. Practice by drawing out some systems you have built in the past on [Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/) or [Miro](https://miro.com/). Most companies have a “walk us through a system you have built in the past” interview, so this exercise helps you prepare for that as well.

1. ### Brush up on your ability to answer behavioral questions
	Companies spent up to half of their interview time on behavioral questions, in various forms. I used to suck at those. In my previous job search, I often had to tell my interviewers that I couldn’t think of any examples of “conflict with my colleagues in my past work” OR “me taking the initiative” on the spot. 

	To avoid that problem, I recommend creating a spreadsheet with the most common questions and for each of them, think of a situation in your life that you could use for the answer. Practice telling it to yourself or a friend. One situation can be used for different questions, but you need to know what to emphasize and what to omit to make it relevant to the question at hand.
	
	Amazon has a list of [14 leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) and the recruiter was adamant that I should prepare at least 2 examples for each, and try to not use the same example for different principles as “the interviewers will regroup after the interviews and compare their notes”. It was hard at first; but after working on and off on it for about 2 weeks, I found an example for most of them. Some "suppressed" memories came back as well and took me by surprise. I totally forgot about those episodes and it's fun now to think back and do a little reflection.
	
	Another way companies assess you on this is through a [topgrading exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topgrading). The traditional form of it is to through your resume and for each of your experience, write your answer for these questions down:
	- What did you do there that you’re most proud of? What were your mistakes there?
	- Why did you leave that position?
	- Who did you work with/report to?
	- If I talk to your partner/manager, what would they say your strengths and weaknesses are?

	Another form of this is the famous [Life Story interview](https://www.shopify.ca/careers/how-we-hire#process) of Shopify.
	
	I dreaded going through all these exercises. It was hard to look back to certain situations and be introspective. What was good? What could have been better? Then some of that, you can spin it in positive light and subtly sell your skills and personality and values in the process (the unflattered things you learn, you can keep it to your own personal development) These exercises are taxing, but, not surprisingly, educational. They will do you good, I promise.

1. ### Do your research
	Find out as much about the company and position as you can. Look at their mission and values and mention that. Check their Glassdoor, TeamBlind, etc. Check out their engineering blog, read some articles and mention that. Learn as much as possible about how they hire, how their levels work, culture, etc. 
	
	This has 3 benefits. First, it shows them that you’re interested. Second, now that you know more about them, you can line up their goals with your personal goals and explain much better why you want to work for them (or realize that you don't). Third, you may pick up some red flags that you can ask your interviewers about (tactfully) to clarify or confirm (frequent overtime? toxic culture?).

1. ### Have a strategy
	Line up a few interviews at the same time so you can study for them at once. Put your favorite company at the end so you have time to practice with other companies first (trust me, the 10th interview feels a lot more relaxing than the 1st). If you get multiple offers at the same time, you also have a better chance at negotiating.
	
	Read up about offer negotiation early, as there are many things you should and shouldn’t do even at **the early stage**. I’ll name a few right now:
	- Don’t say a number for your expected compensation. Just say you don’t know, you want to finish the interviews first, or any reasonable reasons. 
	- Tell them you’re interviewing at a few places to set expectations about the timeline.

	Here are a few “classic” blog posts on negotiating salary for software engineers that I found helpful:
	- [Ten Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/)
	- [How I negotiated a $300,000 offer in Silicon Valley](https://medium.com/@bayareabelletrist/how-i-negotiated-a-software-engineer-offer-in-silicon-valley-f11590f5c656)
	- [Salary negotiation strategies everyone in tech already knows — but you don’t](https://candor.co/guides/salary-negotiation)
	- [Salary Negotiation: Make More Money, Be More Valued](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/)

	I recommend read through them, note down the "rules" and reread them frequently. Many of these rules are unnatural to me, and under stress, I tend to fall back to my habits (I did!). Rereading them frequently would help you remember and rewire yourself.
	
	I even used [Level.FYI's negotiation service](https://www.levels.fyi/services/) to work with a recruiter to negotiate my offers. It did give me some assurance to listen to the perspective of someone who came from other side of the table. Beyond that, I found their insights (at least for compensation in Canada) inaccurate and communication messy and unhelpful. There are many other negotiation services out there, and I'd recommend checking them out if you feel you need help. Talk to them and choose someone you're comfortable working with, as this process is stressful enough by itself.
	
	I have always been afraid of negotiation and had never negotiated successfully in my life up until this point. Thanks to what I learned during this process, I was more successful this time and accepted the offer not feeling like I'd left a lot on the table.

1. ### Do your best
	You're more likely to get an interview if you're referred. So, look at your LinkedIn and reach out for people you know who are working at that company. Besides friends and ex-colleagues, don't be afraid to ask acquaintances with whom you haven't worked. Chances are, they are be happy to give one. If they give you the green light, look at your resume and custom it to the position and the company. Highlight things you think they would care about, remove things that they won't. Write a thoughtful cover letter that highlight the overlap in your values and their mission and your goals and their position. Forward these to your referrer. 
	
	Be prepared for your interviews. This starts with small things: making sure your lighting is good for video conferencing, your space uninterrupted during the interviews, trying out the software on which the interview will be conducted beforehand, making sure links work, etc. 

	Then go the extra mile! I drew out a system diagram of a past project before my “talk about your past project” interviews so I can show them a detailed diagram. A company told me beforehand which system they would ask in the system design portion and I did the whole thing beforehand and prepared a diagram as well. That saved us a lot of time and allowed us to dig deeper into the topic. My interviewers were also impressed with my serious preparation as most people showed up empty handed and tried to think and draw and explain the spot.

	Make the interviewers’ experience as pleasant as possible and see things from their position. Be collaborative. I asked my interviewers “what do you think?” often, just to see if they want to steer somewhere or raise any concerns (you may risk appearing dependent on the interviewer in some people’s eyes, but I don’t see it that way.) I asked the managers “what do you think about the fit between this position and me?” after the interviews to hear their POV. My feedback said I was “thoughtful” and “communicate well” and I would attribute that to this mindset. 

	Gather as much information about the role, team, culture, projects during the interviews, as it will help you make a decision later. Besides, you should always have a few questions to show you're interested. 

### In Summary
If this whole thing sounds like a lot of work, it is. It does get easier as you go through it though. Eventually, it was even enjoyable for me. I got to talk to many people, learn about different things different organizations are working on and had fun imagining myself as part of that. I learned new skills and did lots of reflection on my past. As they say: enjoy the journey. 

All the best for your job search!
