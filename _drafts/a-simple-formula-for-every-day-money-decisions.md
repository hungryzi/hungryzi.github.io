Assume you have an investment instrument that returns 4% a year. With an $X amount invested, at the end of every year, you can withdraw the profit 4% * $X and leave the principal invested to continue generating profit. You can do this forever.

Say that profit is enough for you to live on. So 4% \* $X = annual expense. Thus $X = 25 \* annual expense. 

With 25 times your annual expense invested, you can live off your investment forever. This is the basic *belief* of the [FIRE movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement) (overly simplified by me). There are a lot of nuances to that, and I won't go into them here (read [Mr Money Mustache's](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) if you haven't).  

For this post, I just want to share a simple formula that has helps me quickly visualize the impact of my daily financial choices. I can't say it gives accurate numbers, but rather a helpful point of reference.

Say you want to sign up for something that costs $50/month. That's $600/year. 25 times that is $15,000. That's the extra amount that you need to save and invest in order to afford paying $50/month while living off your investment profits. 

In general, a $100/month expense requires $30,000 saved and invested. Reversely, if you reduce your monthly expenses by $100, it's $30,000 less you need to save and invest.

**$1000 less** spent monthly, **\$300,000 less** needed for investment
**$100 less** spent monthly, **\$30,000 less** needed for investment
**$10 less** spent monthly, **\$3,000 less** needed for investment

Maybe you don't really want that cup of take out coffee?

***

Looking at it from another angle, if you have $X invested right now, how much of your monthly expenses can you cover with $X / 300 (i.e. 25 \* 12)?

**$10,000** invested affords you **\$33** monthly
**$100,000** invested affords you **\$333** monthly

How many % of your life can you afford with your current investment?
